# Warehouse_Stock_Prediction
Warehouse Management plays a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation of the
entire supply chain.Managing the warehouse in an efficient way ensures a lot of benefits
like mitigation of wastage in production processes.
This empowers business to produce just enough to meet the market demand reducing
the unnecessary wastage.Other benefits include an efficient transport system to
streamline delivery routes,maximize truckload and cut down on fuel consumption and
emissions as well as prevent “out of stock situations”. Implementing Machine Learning
in demand forecasting for warehouse management is a game-changer in supply chain
optimization.
Built the model on the basis of an available dataset which has the order details
of 3.5 months ranging from 01-01-2018 to 04-15-2018 (MM-DD-YYYY format) . After doing
weekly forecasting , trained the model with 3 months of data and predicting
for the 0.5 left month using the Arima and Sarima models .Through meticulous analysis
of past trends and patterns the Arima and Sarima models are fine tuned to accurately
forecast demand on a weekly basis.This approach is both scalable and adaptable.
By forecasting demand for the upcoming week based on the preceding three months
data,we give warehouse managers useful information to make sure they have the right
amount of stuff in stock.This helps organize things better,make deliveries smoother and
mitigate the risk of stockouts.
